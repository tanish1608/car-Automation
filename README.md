hello there, this code is about lane detection, object detection by a dash cam. we get the footage from the car dashcam and analize the scene detect the lane ahead and the curvatur of the lane and also detect the cars nearby and how far are they, we cant detect any kind of object not only cars. 

  This is the basic implementation of self driving vehcile, we use OpencCV for image processing, tensorflow prebuild model for object detection, the lane detection part is drawn from another auther.


the following picture shows the sample output for the code above:
